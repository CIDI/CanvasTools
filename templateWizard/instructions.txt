Welcome to the USU Template Wizard. This program was designed by the Center for Innovative Design & Instruction 
at Utah State University.

This program was designed to help with the rapid development of courses and goes hand in hand with the Custom 
Canvas Tools project. To set up this tool you will need to:

1. Host this file on a secure server.
2. Update the 3 variables in the "variableSetup.php" file.
3. Update the urls in the "ltiCode.xml" file.
4. Use the xml to create a new app at whatever level you are going to implement this at (course, account, institution).
