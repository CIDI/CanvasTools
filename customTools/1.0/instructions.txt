This is the first release of the Center for Innovative Design & Instruction's Custom Canvas Tools. 

These tools are a work in progress and will continue to change as time goes on. There is an additional LTI aspect to
these tools, the USU Template Wizard, that will be released in the not too distant future.

To use these tools:
1. Place the files on a secure server
2. Open the "canvasGlobal.js" file
	- Update the "toolsPath" variable to link to the folder containing these tools
	- Update the "globalCSSPath" variable to match your global css file (this is so we can add your global css file to the WYSIWYG editors)
	- Add any courses you want to have access to the tools to the "courseArray"
	- Add any users you want to have access to the tools to the "userArray"
3. Copy the contents of the "canvasGlobal.js" into your institutions global js file
4. Copy the contents of the "canvasGlobal.css" into your institutions global css file
