Welcome to the Syllabus Tracker, created by the Center for Innovative Design & Instruction at Utah State University

The Syllabus Tracker needs to be loaded on a webserver that can handle PHP

In order to deploy this for your institution, there are a few things you will want to change.

variableSetup.php file
1. Add your institutions url on line 25
2. Add an admin user token for the API calls on line 27
3. Update the code in the term drowdown function to match your institutions sis_term_id's in Canvas

When all that is done, go to the index.php file in a browser

	- Click "Save List"
	- Click "Go to Syllabus Tracker"
2. You will need to generate the report files for desired terms

	- Choose a term from the dropdown
	- Click "Begin Process"
